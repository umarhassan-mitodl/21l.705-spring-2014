## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21L.705 Major Authors: Old English and_ Beowulf as it was taught by Associate Professor Arthur Bahr in Spring 2014.

Traditionally, this is a two semester sequence with the first semester covering Old English and the second semester focusing on reading _Beowulf_. This course, however, compressed Old English vocabulary and grammar into the first six weeks, followed by reading and literary critical conversations of several passages in Old English, riddles and _Beowulf_.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

Students should be able to read Old English. When faced with a sentence in Old English, students should be able to navigate it - identifying the verb, subject and cases.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Because of interest from the students in this course, professor Bahr extended _Old English and_ Beowulf into a more advanced course.
